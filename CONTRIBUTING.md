# Contributing to andColorPicker

Contributions of all types are welcome. We use GitHub to host code, track issues, enhancements, and perform project management.

**andColorPicker** is released under the **Apache 2.0 license**. 

This document should help you get started.

## Filing issues

In order to create a new feature request or bug report just file an issue. To file a new issue, please use our issue template and fill out the template as much as possible (remove irrelevant parts). The more information you can provide, the more likely we are to be able to help. Please help us to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project, gist or code snippet that reproduces the problem.

## Contributing

We're maintaining two permanent protected branches: **master** and **develop**. 

- **master** is used for the current release and can't be changed (except non-library files) without a new release.
- **develop** is used to prepare a new release.

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request targeting the develop branch.

- The branching model is similar to git-flow.
- Versioning is similar to Semantic Versioning.

Our code style is defined via a hosted Intelliji xml config.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and code style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
